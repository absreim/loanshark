The project is not too far beyond Koa boilerplate code.

*script/seed.js* contains logic for creating a few default accounts and for syncing the database with Sequelize models.

Sequelize database models and boilerplate code is in *server/db*.

Passport-specific functions are in *server/auth.js*.

Route handlers are in *server/api*.
